[[welcome-to-minishift]]
== Welcome to Minishift!

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a
single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or
develop with it, day-to-day, on your local host.

Minishift uses https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine[libmachine] for
provisioning VMs, and https://github.com/openshift/origin[OpenShift Origin] for running the cluster. The code base is forked from the https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube] project.

[[getting-started]]
== Getting started

Download the binary for installing on Linux from https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases/download/v1.29.0/minishift-1.29.0-linux-amd64.tgz
This will be used to install Minishift on your virtual machine.

Minishift requires a hypervisor to start the virtual machine on which the OpenShift cluster
is provisioned. In our lab we will use Virtual Box which has been provided on the virtual machine.

For detailed installation instructions for Minishift and the required dependencies, see
the https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html[Getting started] documentation.

Extract the content of the tar file with the command : +
`+tar -xvf minishift-1.29.0-darwin-amd64.tgz+` +

Add the minishift binary to your path variable.

Start your minishift instance by executing : +
`+minishift start --vmdriver virtualbox+`

After the server has started you should see something similar to the below

  OpenShift server started.
  The server is accessible via web console at:
       https://192.168.99.128:8443
  You are logged in as:
       User:     developer
       Password: developer
  To login as administrator:
       oc login -u system:admin+`

Try to access the web console using a browser. Your Minishift is now installed.

[[application]]
== Deploy your first application

The first step is to ensure that the oc client is added to your path. Execute :

`+eval $(minishift oc-env)+`

Now you should be able to execute `+oc+`. This will show you the man page for the openshift client.

Create a sample application :

`+oc new-app https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex -l name=myapp+`

Expose the application through a service definition

`+oc expose svc/nodejs-ex+`

Access your application using a browser :

`+minishift openshift service nodejs-ex --in-browser+`

You can also check your application project using the console. Open the console on the right side you should see a default MyProject which was created during setup.
